## What I Have Learned About Github

### Markdown

Markdown is an extremely useful tool which can help you format your posts on github and make it look better and have it be organized.

### GitFlow

I learned a lot about github and how to use markdown to organize my posts and make it better for the reader experience.
I was surprised by how difficult something can be when you are learning markdown or how to properly format the paper.
Im trying to learn more about how to master markdown and to use github and all of its tools.
